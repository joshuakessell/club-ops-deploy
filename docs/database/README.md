# Database docs (canonical contract)

The canonical sources of truth for **database/schema meaning**, **table/column contracts**, and **invariants** are:

- `docs/database/DATABASE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`
- `docs/database/DATABASE_ENTITY_DETAILS.md`

All other schema overviews and scattered notes across the repo are **non-authoritative** and must defer to these docs.

If there is any conflict, **these docs win** (update code/migrations/docs elsewhere to match).
